# Python_Live_Project
 This will show and explain some of my Python Live Project completed at The Tech Academy.
 ## Introduction
 Participating in a live project has been a great experience. This allowed me to create a full-stack app within an existing codebase. It became apparent how Django's MVT framework allows for rapid expansion of an app. We each got our own set of stories allowing us to develop in the front end, using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap4, and the back end, using Python, to add improvements and new functionality.
 Below is a summary of my two week sprint with explanations and code snippets for clarity.
 ## CRUD Functionality
 Our app allows its user to collect or track something. My portion allows a user to track mountain bike trails they would like to visit in an app called LOAM. Over a handful of stories LOAM gained full CRUD functionality.
 ### Create
 This full-stack story required a Python model, a Django modelform and building a user facing template built primarily of Bootstrap4.
 
 ### Read
 The next two stories required us to list the data saved to our database and then retrieve and display a saved instance.
 
 ### Update and Delete
 Updating the instance went smooth but I admittedly stumbled with getting a url for deleting to function correctly. This is where working with a team is so great. We were able to right my oversight and I was able to learn from it at the same time.
